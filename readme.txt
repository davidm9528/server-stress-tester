Final Year Project. 

Developing a system for stress testing a server that distributes questions to students' clients and
then collects and records the answers, mimicking an arbitrary
number of clients, where it will be possible to configure the number and timing of the requests. 

The parameters of primary interest in stress tests are as follows:

- Virtual users
- Passed requests
- Response transfer speed
- Errors
- Warnings

When the server crashes, you may find this out by response transfer speed decrease, or the number of passed requests. 
In addition, the server may report errors.

Where possible: 
- Configure the NUMBER and TIMING of requests
- Report on the server's performance
- Possible to configure the content of the messages to be exchanged.
